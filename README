The task was to implement a function to calculate the log probability of a given tree. The changes made to the baseline
code in order to implement this functionality are all situated in the 'BaselineCkyParser.java' file and involve the
implementation of the following functions:

    (1) void extractUnaryRules(Tree<String>, Collection<UnaryRule>)

    (2) void extractBinaryRules(Tree<String>, Collection<BinaryRule>)

    (3) void extractPreterminalRules(Tree<String>, Collection<UnaryRule>)

    (4) double getLogScore(Tree<String>)

(1) This is a recursive function that given a tree will extract all pre-terminal rules and add them to a parameter
    collection.

(2) This is a recursive function that given a tree will extract all binary rules and add them to a parameter collection.

(3) This is a recursive function that given a tree will extract all preterminal binary rules and add them to a parameter
    collection.

(4) In order to calculate the log-score this function will first obtain all the pre-terminal & binary rules from the
    given tree. After that the score will be calculated as follows:

        for each pre-terminal rule:
            rule_score <- get tag score from lexicon (scoreTagging)
            score <- score + log(rule_score)
        for each unary rule:
            rule_score <- get rule score from grammar
            score <- score + log(rule_score)
        for each binary rule:
            rule_score <- get rule score from grammar
            score <- score + log(rule_score)
        return score
