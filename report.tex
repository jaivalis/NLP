\section{Introduction}
This report is about Assignment 1 of the UvA course Elements of Natural Language Processing. The goal of Assignment 1 is to compute the probability of a given tree.\\
The steps taken in order to do that are explained in Implementation.

\section{Implementation}
In order to achieve the goal of the assignment, the function \texttt {getLogScore(Tree<String> tree)} has to be implemented. The tree is traversed recursively and both binary rules and unary rules are extracted.\\
The passing through the tree to get the rules is done by the functions \texttt{extractUnaryRules}, \texttt{extractPreterminalRules} and \texttt{extractBinaryRules}.\\
The score of non-preterminal rules is extracted by its score in the grammar obtained by the training trees. Preterminal unary rules are scored by the training trees lexicons \texttt{scoreTagging(String word, String tag)} function.
Finally the logarithm of each rule's score is summed up.\\
There are some \emph{-Infinity} showing up in the scoring of the test trees, which occur, since some rules do not appear in the training data and the logarithm of their score (0) is \emph{-Infinity}.\\

\section{Conclusion}
In this assignment the familiarizing with the given code, the implementation of recursive functions to extract the rules of a tree and the evaluation of the scoring of a tree have been completed.
